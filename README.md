# Quizzical

A Trivia Web App made with ❤️ and React

If you just want to see the quiz in action, you can see the live version at:- 
https://pabloescoder-quizzical.vercel.app/ 

If you want to look how this was made/modify it, I recommend setting it up locally. 

### Prerequisites (for running it locally)

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### How to setup & run the app locally

- Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/pabloescoder/quizzical-app.git`)

- Go to the project directory (`cd quizzical-app/`)
- Run `npm install`
- Wait for npm to install all the dependencies (might take some time)
- Run `npm start`
- Wait for the development server to start
- Once started you can view the react app at http://localhost:3000/
- You can stop the development server by pressing `Ctrl + c` and `y` (if prompted) in the terminal from where you started it.
